# QuadrupedV1-CAD
CAD Repo for version 1 of my quadruped design  


## 1: Description
This repo does not contain any code or electrical schematics for the robot. There will only be SW, STEP, and 3MF files included. This is also a rough design for a rough quadruped design with the sole objective of standing up and walking. Further major developments will be in a different repo.
